# Date Arithmetic #

<br>

The repository contains a simple web application for the calculation of the difference between two dates.
It is a stand-alone application, i.e. no server backend is required.
The application is developed to be used on mobile devices (e.g. smartphones), so [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/)
was used for the user interface.
