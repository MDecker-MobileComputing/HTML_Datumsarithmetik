# Date Arithmetic

The repository contains a simple web application for the calculation of the difference between two dates.
Since the web application is stand-alone no server backend is required.
The application is developed to be used on mobile devices (e.g. smartphones), so [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/)
is used for the user interface.
